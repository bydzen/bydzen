Greetings. I'm Sultan Kautsar, catalyst of innovation in the realm of tech and commerce. My optimism is a beacon that illuminates even the darkest corners of the digital labyrinth.

I've founded Rayatiga, a sanctuary for static web development, where pixels dance to creative command. Landing pages, portfolios, and digital identities are my canvas, and I wield the brushstrokes of code with finesse.

Telkom University provided me with a strong foundation for my academic success. I earned a cum laude degree with a GPA of 3.74, which I attribute to hard work and perseverance.

Breef Studio served as a valuable stepping stone in my career, where I honed my web development skills as a full-time developer. While I appreciate the experience, I'm eager to take on new challenges and explore further opportunities.

I've embarked on several exciting resources that showcase my ability to craft visually stunning and user-friendly digital experiences.
