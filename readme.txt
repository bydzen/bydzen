Hi, I'm Sultan Kautsar. I've always been curious about how technology can 
genuinely help people, not just impress them. That curiosity led me to build 
Rayatiga, not to chase big titles but to create solutions that quietly make a 
difference for businesses trying to grow.

I focus on web & mobile development and love working with small and medium 
enterprises because they're driven by real passion. For me, technology isn't 
about showing off, it's about making things work better for real people.

My background in Information Technology from Telkom University has shaped my 
technical skills in web & mobile development, cloud engineering, and business 
innovation. But I believe what matters even more is sincerity. I deliver every 
project carefully, listen first, and build with heart.

I'm always happy to meet people who share this mindset: to innovate not for 
the sake of being "modern," but to create meaningful impact together. If that 
resonates with you, feel free to reach out.
