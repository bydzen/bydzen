Greetings, I'm Sultan Kautsar (sultankautsar.com), a passionate innovator at
the intersection of technology and business. With an optimistic approach, I
navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape, turning ideas into impactful
solutions.

I founded Rayatiga (rayatiga.com) as a dedicated space for static web
development, specializing in landing pages, portfolios, and digital identities.
With a keen eye for design and a strong technical foundation, I create seamless,
engaging digital experiences.

My academic journey at Telkom University (telkomuniversity.ac.id) laid the
groundwork for my success. Graduating cum laude with a GPA of 3.74, I attribute
my achievements to perseverance, discipline, and a deep curiosity for learning.

Professionally, my time at Breef Studio (breefstudio.com) was instrumental in
refining my web development expertise. As a full-time developer, I gained
invaluable experience in crafting high-quality digital solutions. Now, I'm
eager to embrace new challenges and expand my horizons.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I continuously explore innovative projects
that blend functionality with aesthetic excellence, striving to deliver
user-friendly and visually compelling digital experiences.
